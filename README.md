# Tank-Fill-Estimation
A computationally efficient tank‑fill estimation framework that integrates YOLO‑Mini for initial tank localization with Hough‑based circular geometry refinement to enhance boundary accuracy and positional mapping. This is complemented by a shadow‑analysis module that quantifies illumination‑derived cues to infer relative fill levels from optical imagery.
